This is based on the demo implementation of a Linux command line tool to access
the U-Boot's environment variables.  Almost all functions are re-written because
of NAND flash and new environment flags index.  Also, it only deals with the 
case when two environment partitions are on NAND.  And the environment size
and the NAND erase block are both assumed to be 0x20000.

The environment locations can be specified in a system file "/etc/fw_env.config".
If this file does not exist, the following default values will be used
#define DEVICE1_NAME	"/dev/mtd1"
#define DEVICE2_NAME	"/dev/mtd2"
#define DEVICE1_OFFSET    0x0000
#define DEVICE2_OFFSET    0x0000

This sys_monitor application can be multiple-used.  If called normally, sys_monitor
will update the environment setting "fail_start" to "no" and then shall move on
to other monitoring tasks.  But it can be used to print and set environment settings.

To print, create a link to it by "ln -s sys_monitor print_env".
Then, ./print_env will print all environment settings, 
while ./print_env setting_name will print individual setting_name.

To set, create a link to it by "ln -s sys_monitor set_env".
Then, ./set_env setting name will remove individual seeting_name,
while ./set_env setting_name new_setting will set setting_name to new_setting.
