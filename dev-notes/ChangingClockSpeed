To change the imx28 clock speed
Note:  when the following change was tried the Modem does not come up with the ttyACMx ports at lower speeds.  
Might need to change order (or remove the highest speed) in bus_freq.h and rebuild the kernel to test if this is caused by the speed changing from the
(default) highest value, or it is just the speed itself that causes the problem.

Changing the speed results in the immediate disappearance of the /dev/ttyACMx ports.

What was added:

echo 360000> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed
to
/etc/rc.d/start-redstone

See the directory:
mx28/linux-2.6.35.3/arch/arm/mach-mx28/

for implementation.
