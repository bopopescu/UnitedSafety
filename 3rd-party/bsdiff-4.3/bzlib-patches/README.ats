The patches in this directory should be applied in order to produce an optimal
build of "bspatch" for the TRULink (ARM). Since the TRULink just applies patches
(and does not do diffs) the "bsdiff" program is not needed (but could be used in
the future).

An optimal "bspatch" application is one that is as small as possible, while still being
able to perform patches without error and in a reasonable amount of time.

The Create-Release system uses "bspatch" to generate differential patches.

See Issue "Feature 1329" in the TRULink tracker for more details.
