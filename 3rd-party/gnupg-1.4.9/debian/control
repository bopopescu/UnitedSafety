Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440.
 .
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms so it cannot be compatible
 with PGP2 because it uses IDEA (which is patented worldwide).

Description: GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is a stripped-down version of gnupg which is only able to check
 signatures.  It is smaller than the full-blown gnupg and uses a
 different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to
 make the signature are trustworthy.
