mutt (1.5.11+cvs20060126-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to CVS 2006-01-26; since this includes a huge diff between
    ChangeLog and ChangeLog.old (moved entries), prepare a new tarball.
    Some worth-mentioning changes:

    + Mutt can now expand its own variables as it does with envvars; for
      example, it's now possible to put something like this into a hook:
      set sendmail="mysmtp -f $from".

    + Support for user-defined variables starting with my_; environment
      variables take precedence, and expansion does not occur in shell-escape.

    + Pattern group support, as explained (only!) in:
        <http://does-not-exist.org/mail-archives/mutt-dev/msg05693.html>

    + Loooots of improvments in the IMAP code, including sync speed-ups
      (through pipelining), hcache stuff (eg. $imap_cachedir), and things
      like $imap_idle and support for the "old" flag in IMAP folders.

  * Rework the package build system to fit personal preference:
    + debhelperize debian/rules a bit more.
    + drop dbs in favor of quilt; reorganize patches a bit.

      (NOTE: quilt means that dropping patches into debian/patches is
      no longer enough to get them applied; they must be listed in the
      debian/patches/series file.)

  * Adjustments to debian/control:
    + use '*' for the bulleted list, instead of 'o'.
    + build-depend on gawk instead of mawk, to have "nextfile".
    + drop conflicts and replaces on packages that are not in woody.

  * Updated debian/copyright.

  * Added debian/watch.

  * Update to CVS 2005-11-24 to fix the following bug (yay):

    + does not fail to open messages that contain base64-encoded inline PGP
      bits (signature, encrypted hunk, or a key). (Closes: #340116)

      Also, do not report success to decrypt an inline PGP message when
      decryption actually failed.

  * Again, update my e-mail address in debian/control, yada yada.

mutt (1.5.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to CVS 2005-11-01, with the following worth-of-mentioning goodies
    (among others):

    + full read/write >2 GB mbox support.
    + attachment counting patch merged upstream (%X in index_format); check
      the "Attachment Searching and Counting" section in the manual for more
      information.

    And the following bugs are fixed as well:

    + S/MIME keys can be selected from the menu.  (Closes: #318470)
    + clarified description of pop_checkinterval. (Closes: #320642)

  * Update my e-mail address in debian/control.

mutt (1.5.11-2) unstable; urgency=low (but fixes critical bug not in testing)

  * The fix for coping with mboxes bigger than 2 GB introduced a bug affecting
    at least powerpc (but not i386) which made mutt write Content-Length: 0 in
    mboxes due to a un-updated %ld format specifier. This caused for mail to
    be lost in the next mbox write.

    Apply a patch quickly provided by upstream (thanks, Brendan Cully!) that
    makes mutt use the right format specifier. (Closes: #330474)

  * Update the compressed folders to the 1.5.11, which includes documentation
    in XML format.

 -- Adeodato Sim√≥ <asp16@alu.ua.es>  Fri, 30 Sep 2005 01:15:28 +0200

mutt (1.5.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, fixing the following bugs:

    + ~h can match folded headers. (Closes: #319654)
    + implements progress indication when uploading messages to an imap
      folder. (Closes: #228713)
    + limit pattern is properly displayed when zero messages matched.
      (Closes: #242398)

    A further CVS pull (2005-09-24) fixes the following bugs:

    + can open mboxes bigger than 2 GB. (Closes: #296940)
    + does not require GPG_TTY to be set in order to accept using the GnuPG
      agent: it'll set the variable itself if not present. (Closes: #316388)
    + does not segfault when replying to a message if content_type is unset.
      (Closes: #329306)
    + does not segfault with IMAP folder completion. (Closes: #329442)

    Packaging changes needed:

    + Upstream documentation now comes in XML, so changed Build-Dependency on
      linuxdoc-tools-text and groff to xsltproc, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl and
      links. Added patch debian/patches/doc_build_adjustments.diff to force
      the use of links instead of lynx for generating the text version of the
      manual, and to not ignore errors from links and xsltproc.

    + Changed --with-sasl2 to its new name --with-sasl in debian/rules;
      removed extra hunk on debian/patches/patch-1.5.4.Md.sasl2-1arc.

    + Rediffed 080_Md.Muttrc, removed patch.asp.fix-bug-266493.1 (applied
      upstream).

    + Temporarily removed documentation from the compressed-folders patch,
      until upstream reacts to the move to XML.

  * Build against libgnutls12 (build-depend on libgnutls-dev instead of
    libgnutls11-dev). (Closes: #323279)

  * Remove spurious dash in argument to -encrypt in smime_encrypt_command.
    (Closes: #315319)

mutt (1.5.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, fixing the following bugs:
    + does not store gpg passphrase when signing or decrypting has failed,
      since that probably means it was wrong. (Closes: #132548)
    + does not fail to delete attachments in unencrypted mails. (Closes:
      #302500)

  * New functionality overview or otherwise noticeable news:
    + $imap_check_subscribed variable to add the list of subscribed folders to
      the buffy list.
    + $braille_friendly variable to make Mutt more usable for blind users.
    + $imap_login variable in case the login name on the IMAP server is
      different to the name of the account ($imap_user).
    + -D command line option to dump current configuration, after all
      initialization files have been read.
    + $imap_force_ssl gone.
    + an empty limit is now interpreted as a request to cancel the current
      limit.

  * Patches:
    + 080_Md.paths_mutt.man: adjusted; upstream build system puts now the
      right paths in mutt.1 using @bindir@. Install mutt.1 instead of mutt.man
      in debian/rules.
    + 080_Md.Muttrc: don't set menu_move_off in /etc/Muttrc since the
      compile-time default is now what we want (pre-1.5.7 compatible).
    + edit-threads, current-shortcut, incomplete-mbyte: removed, integrated
      upstream.
    + maildir-mtime: s/if/ifdef/ to get it to apply.
    + compressed-folders: updated to 1.5.10.

  * Upstream now builds "complete" documentation, i.e., for all features
    whether enabled or not. Disable that for Debian. [patch.docs-match-config.h]

  * Build-Depend on autotools-dev and use updated config.{guess,sub} at build
    time to fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD. (Closes: #302735)

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).

  * Set myself as the maintainer, and remove Marco from Uploaders as agreed
    with him.

mutt (1.5.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, though the previous upload already included most of
    it because of the CVS pull. Do another one now (2005-04-03), including the
    following bits from 1.5.10:
    + several translation updates (de, id, nl, pl, ru).
    + a patch by Daniel Jacobowitz to synchronise message flags before moving
      messages. (Closes: #163616)

  * Also, the header cache patch is now fully integrated upstream, so drop it.

  * Don't set pipe_default in debian/patches/080_Md.Muttrc, and stick to
    upstream's default (unset). (Closes: #300830)

  * Updated the compressed folders patch to version 1.5.9.

  * Updated patch 080_Md.Muttrc to restore the old behaviour of the index.

mutt (1.5.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, with a CVS pull to get all the translation updates
    that happen right after a release. New features worth mentioning:
    + the PGP auto decode patch by Derek Martin has been accepted upstream,
      so inline PGP messages are automatically verified/decrypted now if
      $pgp_auto_decode is set. (Closes: #269699)
    + IDN decoding can be disabled by unseting $use_idn (set by default).
    + new hook 'send2-hook', which gets executed each time there is a change
      in a message being composed. This permits, for example, to match against
      recipients added manually after writing the mail, which wasn't possible
      with 'send-hook' alone.
    + Christoph Berg's menu_context patch is also included. Check the
      $menu_context and $menu_move_off variables.

  * This version also includes the following fixes:
    + message flags are not lost after editing a message. (Closes: #275060)
    + IMAP folder paths ending with the delimiter are trimmed so that they
      don't fail to open with some servers, e.g. Courier. (Closes: #277665)
    + the correct charset is used when signing a forwarded message.
      (Closes: #295528)
    + correctly forget the S/MIME passphrase. (Closes: #300516)

  * Explicitly pass --enable-inodesort to ./configure, since upstream has
    disabled it by default in this version.

  * Updated the compressed folders patch to version 1.5.8.

  * Dropped the adjust_line and adjust_edited_file patches from
    extra-patches/mutt-ja-compat, incorporated upstream. Renamed
    mutt-ja-compat to assumed-charset, since that's the only patch that
    remains.

  * Lots of patches in the Debian package have been applied upstream, drop
    them (16 in total). Worth mentioning is the gnutls patch. The
    maildir_inode_sort patch has been adopted too, with the static functions
    no longer being nested, which closes: #287744 (FTBFS with gcc-4.0).

  * Implemented a conf.d style directory for mutt: other packages or local
    admins may now drop configuration snippets in /etc/Muttrc.d/*.rc and have
    them sourced at the end of the default Muttrc. (Closes: #285574)

  * Updated the header cache patch to version 28. The size of this patch has
    been drastically reduced, since the generic code and the IMAP support has
    been incorporated upstream.

  * Updated the compressed folders patch to version 1.5.8.

  * Use mixmaster-filter by default. (Closes: #299060)

    [New file: upstream/patches/decrypt-save_non-empty-output]

    [Modified file: upstream/extra-patches/header-cache]

  * The mutt BTS has been closed due to excessive spam in their debbugs

mutt (1.5.6-20040907+2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A "Let's procrastinate some important stuff and fix a bunch of mutt bugs
    instead" release.

  * Include small patch to fix the Swedish translation, which was making
    impossible to turn off pgp signing and/or encrypting. (Closes: #281265)
    [New file: upstream/patches/i18n-sv-fix.diff]

  * Make the default Muttrc work out the box for people using gnupg-agent.
    Wrote and applied a one-line patch to make the %?p? conditional escape
    work correctly, patch forwarded upstream. (Closes: #277646)
    [New file: debian/patches/patch.asp.%p-escape-agent-compatible.1]

  * Relocate the definition of the USE_GNUTLS macro, so that it gets passed to
    the documentation build process too. Otherwise, options that end up in the
    manual wouldn't match those that are really compiled in. (Closes: #278124)
    [Modified files: debian/rules, upstream/extra-patches/gnutls.debian]

  * Honour /etc/alternatives/pager in the muttbug script. (Closes: #275448)
    [Modified file: debian/patches/080_Md.muttbug]

  * Include patch by Nicolas Fran√ßois <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net> to
    fix typo in muttrc.5. (Closes: #272579)
    [New file: debian/patches/patch.nf.fix-bug-272579.1]

  * Updated the (formerly unmaintained) current-shortcut patch with a new
    version by Christoph Berg <cb@df7cb.de>. Now the actual used Fcc will be
    shown instead of '^' when you folder-hook . 'set record="^"'.
    [Modified file: upstream/extra-patches/current-shortcut]

  * Updated the header-cache patch to version 24.

mutt (1.5.6-20040907+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to CVS snapshot 20040907 (includes updated ja translation).

  * The maildir-mtime patch is now NOT enabled by default, you need to set the
    maildir_mtime variable in your ~/.muttrc. This variable has been necessary
    since people with large maildirs over NFS experienced a large performance
    impact with the mtime patch enabled. (Closes: #253261)

  * Updated the header cache patch to version 21. This fixes a file descriptor
    leak which could cause problems for people who keep their mutt open for a
    long time. Also includes support for per-folder cache: setting $header_cache
    to a directory will enable it, and you should experience some performance
    gains.

  * Included the current shortcut patch. It's completely unintrusive and
    allows you to specify ^ as a shortcut for the current folder (e.g., in a
    Fcc). (Closes: #253104)

  * Updated the autotools stuff. Include in it also stuff from patches, so
    that --enable-foo options can be used in debian/rules. Put files directly
    in extra/autotools and cp from there in debian/rules instead of using a
    patch file (which was too big due to automake1.4/autoconf2.13 => 1.8/2.50
    migration).

  * debian/rules:
    + use --enable-compresed --enable-hcache --without-gdbm in configure.
    + copy autotools files from extra/autotools when unpacking, and emulate
      the 000_Md.config.h.in patch.

  * debian/patches/:
    + removed 000_Md.config.h.in, no longer needed since config.h.in is now
      overwritten from extra/autotools.
    + added patch.asp.fix-bug-266493.1, which makes mutt not wait for a
      keypress to handle SIGWINCH in certain situations. (Closes: #123943,
      #266493)

mutt (1.5.6-20040818+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The post-Sarge era officially begins for mutt. This mostly means
    that patch inclusion policy will untighten a bit.

  * Added the maildir/imap header caching patch by Thomas Glanzmann, see:
    <http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~sithglan/mutt>. For a quick
    start, read documentation for the $header_cache variable.
    (Closes: #242762, #255475)

  * Added the maildir-mtime patch by Dale Woolridge, see
    <http://www.mutt.ca/maildir-mtime.html>. This patch should make happy
    users that use maildir and have $sort_browser=reverse-date.
    (Closes: #253261)

  * Reorganized patches location:
    + patches not written by the mutt maintainers are now in the
      upstream/extra-patches directory.
    + each patch in that directory now contains a preamble listing:
      - the patch author
      - the patch home page
      - last time patch was updated
      - exact URL to the patch file
      - applied changes, if any
    + all preambles are available in the doc/README.Patches file, and
      debian/copyright now points to this file too.

  * Other changes in upstream/extra-patches/:
    + updated the edit-threads patch.
    + updated the compressed-folders patch.

  * Updated to CVS snapshot 20040818:
    + various memory leaks spotted and fixed.
    + several translations updated: pl, sv, fr, id, nl, de, ca, cs.
      The Czech translation addresses a bad chosen shorcut in the crypt menu,
      and thus closes: #140639. Updated German translation closes: #265120.
    + fix some UI flaws in the new PGP and S/MIME menus which could easily
      make the user send in clear mail which was meant to be signed and/or
      encrypted (the (e)ncrypt, (s)ign and (b)oth commands were toggles).
      Also renamed the (f)orget action to (c)lear for newbie's benefit; accept
      the (f) key for long time users' benefit.
    + make mutt not hang if STARTTLS fails to complete the SSL handshake.
    + try all methods in $imap_authenticators when one of them fails;
      previously mutt would give up upon the first of them failing.

  * debian/:
    + scripts/vars: add upstream/extra-patches to SRC_PATCH_DIR.
    + control: Build-Depend on libdb4.2-dev for the header-cache patch.
    + rules: call scripts/patch-preamble to create the README.Patches file.
    + copyright: add pointer to README.Patches, where patch authors are listed.

  * debian/patches/:
    + updated 000_VERSION to reflect new snapshot date.
    + removed obsolete #defines from 000_Md.config.h.in. Added #include
      "debian-config.h" there, which is used by upstream/extra-patches/*.debian.
    + removed patch.asp.fix-bug-260578.1, included upstream.

  * debian/rules: sort the PATCHES file, which is printed by `mutt -v`.

  * Updated to CVS snapshot 20040722:
    + bugfixes:
      - does not segfault when chdir'ing to a directory without read
        permission. (Closes: #237426)
      - does not segfault when applying check-traditional-pgp to multiple
        messages. (Closes: #257277)
      - uses the right From address when composing a new message from the
        pager and $reverse_name is set. (Closes: #249870)
      - initial IMAP header download does not take quadratic time on the
        number of messages. (Closes: #213412)
    + new functionality:
      - support for spam-scoring filters (see ¬ß3.24 of the fine manual).
      - $include_onlyfirst: controls whether or not Mutt includes only the
        first attachment of the message you are replying.
      - $hide_thread_subject: when unset, mutt will show the subject for all
        messages in a thread.
      - uses List-Post header when doing list-reply. (Initial RFC 2369 support,
        closes: #49048)
  * debian/patches/:
    + updated 000_VERSION to reflect new snapshot date.
    + updated the following patches to apply cleanly:

      - patch-1.5.3.cd.edit_threads.9.2-1arc [mutt.h]
    + updated patch-1.5.6.tt.compat.1 (does not close #259145).
    + removed patch-1.5.3.Md.gpg-agent, issue fixed upstream.
    + added patch-1.5.6.helmersson.incomplete-mbyte.2 by Anders Helmersson
      to avoid passing incomplete multibyte sequences to regexec(), which can
      cause segfaults due to libc6 Bug#261135. (Closes: #254314, #260623)
      [Yes, this is a sequel, not a dej√†-vu.]
    + added patch.asp.fix-bug-{210679,254294,258621,260578}.1, which fix
      several minor issues unaddressed by upstream for some time. All patches
      submitted upstream. (Closes: #210679, #254294, #258621, #260578). 
  * debian/rules:
    + be robust to any locale by exporting LC_ALL=C. (Closes: #253048)
    + touch some autotools files to prevent having them to be built again.
  * Using "urgency=high" at maintainer's discretion
