         protocol the daemon uses.
  * [ef59451f] Ignore symbols files changes when DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS is
    set. Not stripping the library leaves some additional symbols, so we
    just ignore that when the package is being built with debug options.
    (Closes: #572705) - thanks to Timo Juhani Lindfors

  * Removing Tachometer.c due to an unclear licensing, this introduces
    .dfsg to the version number and results in not being able to build
    xgpsspeed.
  * Building new packages:
    - python-gps containing the python modules, this also fixes a bug
      complaining about missing python-support (Closes: #413925)

    devices use nothing but a standard usb to serial converter. This resulted
    in trouble if you wanted to use a normal serial converter without attached

      * Kenshi Muto - Japanese translation (Closes: #412507)
  * debian/rules:
    - Rewriting file completely. This also introduces new files to the
      packaging (debian/{gpsd,gpsd-clients}.install, debian/gpsd.examples)
      and removes several unused/obsolete files:
      (debian/{remove_rpath.sh,gpsd-clients.docs}, debian/*.dirs,
       debian/gpsd.lintian-overrides).
  * debian/watch, debian/dfsg-clean.sh:

      non-free material automatically.
