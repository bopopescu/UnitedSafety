.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function(gnutls_pkcs11_pin_callback_t " fn ", void * " userdata ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs11_pin_callback_t fn" 12
The PIN callback
.IP "void * userdata" 12
data to be supplied to callback
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set a callback function to be used when a PIN
is required for PKCS 11 operations.

Callback for PKCS\fB11\fP PIN entry.  The callback provides the PIN code
to unlock the token with label 'token_label', specified by the URL 
'token_url'.

The PIN code, as a NUL\-terminated ASCII string, should be copied
into the 'pin' buffer (of maximum size pin_max), and
return 0 to indicate success. Alternatively, the callback may
return a negative gnutls error code to indicate failure and cancel
PIN entry (in which case, the contents of the 'pin' parameter are ignored).

When a PIN is required, the callback will be invoked repeatedly
(and indefinitely) until either the returned PIN code is correct,
the callback returns failure, or the token refuses login (e.g. when
the token is locked due to too many incorrect PINs!).  For the
first such invocation, the 'attempt' counter will have value zero;
it will increase by one for each subsequent attempt.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP is returned, otherwise a
negative error value.
