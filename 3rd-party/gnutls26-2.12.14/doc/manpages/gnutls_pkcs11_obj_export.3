.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t obj" 12

.IP "void * output_data" 12
will contain a certificate PEM or DER encoded
.IP "size_t * output_data_size" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will export the pkcs11 object data. It is normal
for PKCS \fB11\fP data to be inaccesible and in that case \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP
will be returned.

If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
*output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will
be returned.

If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header
of "BEGIN CERTIFICATE".
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
In case of failure a negative value will be
returned, and 0 on success.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
