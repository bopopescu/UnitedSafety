.SH NAME
gnutls_priority_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_priority_init(gnutls_priority_t * " priority_cache ", const char * " priorities ", const char ** " err_pos ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache" 12
is a \fBgnutls_prioritity_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * priorities" 12
is a string describing priorities
.IP "const char ** err_pos" 12
In case of an error this will have the position in the string the error occured
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets priorities for the ciphers, key exchange methods, macs and
compression methods.

The \fBpriorities\fP option allows you to specify a colon
separated list of the cipher priorities to enable.
.SH "COMMON KEYWORDS"
Some keywords are defined to provide quick access
to common preferences.

"PERFORMANCE" means all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled,
limited to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by terms of speed
performance.

"NORMAL" means all "secure" ciphersuites. The 256\-bit ciphers are
included as a fallback only.  The ciphers are sorted by security
margin.

"SECURE128" means all "secure" ciphersuites with ciphers up to 128
bits, sorted by security margin.

"SECURE256" means all "secure" ciphersuites including the 256 bit
ciphers, sorted by security margin.

"EXPORT" means all ciphersuites are enabled, including the
low\-security 40 bit ciphers.

"NONE" means nothing is enabled.  This disables even protocols and
compression methods.
.SH "SPECIAL KEYWORDS"
"!" or "\-" appended with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.

"+" appended with an algorithm will add this algorithm.

Check the GnuTLS manual section "Priority strings" for detailed
information.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

"NONE:+VERS\-TLS\-ALL:+MAC\-ALL:+RSA:+AES\-128\-CBC:+SIGN\-ALL:+COMP\-NULL"

"NORMAL:\-ARCFOUR\-128" means normal ciphers except for ARCFOUR\-128.

"SECURE:\-VERS\-SSL3.0:+COMP\-DEFLATE" means that only secure ciphers are
enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled, and libz compression enabled.

"NONE:+VERS\-TLS\-ALL:+AES\-128\-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP\-NULL:+SIGN\-RSA\-SHA1", 

"NORMAL:\fBCOMPAT\fP" is the most compatible mode.
.SH "RETURNS"
On syntax error \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP is returned,
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
