autossh (1.4a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  Automatic (random) guess of the port has been introduced, this means you can
  invoke autossh <host> without specifying -M <monitorport>.
  
  Backward compatibility is retained, you are free to use -M to force a
  specific monitor port or use autossh -- -M <host> for passing -M to ssh.
