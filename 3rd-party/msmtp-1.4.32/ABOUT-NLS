If you would like to translate msmtp into your language, please contact
<msmtp-users@lists.sourceforge.net> for details and coordination. Please keep in
mind that a translation will have to be updated regularly as msmtp changes, and
unmaintained translations will have to be removed.

Msmtp uses the gettext system for translations. To add a translation, e.g. for
pt (portuguese), add a line "pt" to po/LINGUAS. Then update the translation
template msmtp.pot:
    $ cd po
    $ make msmtp.pot
and copy it to your new translation file:
    $ cp msmtp.pot pt.po
Then translate the strings in pt.po. See the existing *.po files for examples.
Activate your translation with this command:
    $ make update-po
With the correct locale setting, your translation should be available after
'make install'.

There are special translation editors such as poedit <http://www.poedit.net/>
that can help, and there are several guides available online, e.g.
<http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Gettext_Guide>.
