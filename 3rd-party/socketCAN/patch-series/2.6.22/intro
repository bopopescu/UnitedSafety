CAN: Add new PF_CAN protocol family
ESUBJECT

This patch series applies against linux-2.6.22 and is derived from
Subversion revision r455 of http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan.
It can be found in the directory
http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/socketcan/trunk/patch-series/<version>.

This patch doesn't touch anything in the kernel except for the allocation
of a couple of numbers for protocol, arp hw type, and a line discipline.
