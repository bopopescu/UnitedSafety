.TH CAN 7 2006-11-28 "Socket CAN" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
can \-  Linux CAN implementation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <linux/can.h>
.br
.B #include <linux/can/raw.h>
.br
.B raw_socket = socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_RAW);
.br
.B bcm_socket = socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_DGRAM, CAN_BCM);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an implementation of the CAN protocols for Linux, based on the
Berkeley socket API.  It consits of network device drivers for a
number of CAN interface cards, a CAN core module which implements a
new protocol family PF_CAN, and CAN protocol implementations which can
be loaded as kernel modules.  The current GPL implementation covers
two protocol modules, a raw socket interface and the broadcast manager
(BCM) for efficiently handling periodically sent CAN messages.
