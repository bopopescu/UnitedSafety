netcat (1.10-38) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move nc.1 from debian/ to top level directory, so that debian/ is not
    a self-referential patch. This will allow the package to trivially be
    converted to 3.0 (quilt) format. Thanks to Raphael Hertzog for pointing
    this out. (Closes: #485178)
  * Clarify documentation for -q.

netcat (1.10-37) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Mon, 25 Feb 2008 18:47:34 -0500

netcat (1.10-36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename binary package from "netcat-base" to "netcat-traditional", per
    request of ftp-master.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Wed, 30 Jan 2008 18:26:25 -0500

netcat (1.10-35) unstable; urgency=low

  * Netcat has been split into netcat-traditional (built by this package),
    and netcat-openbsd (a rewritten implementation). The command and man
    page will be managed by the alternatives system. This package generates
    a transitional "netcat" package that will depend on netcat-traditional.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Tue, 22 Jan 2008 20:46:16 -0500

netcat (1.10-34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename TOS option from -x to -T. This is painful, but it was never a
    standard option, and will be needed for command-line compatibility with
    other implementations of netcat. Forcing them to rename -x is not
    viable.
  * Don't return EXIT_FAILURE from -h, and include debian revision number
    in its output. (Closes: #457171)
  * Include portability fix for Darwin. (Closes: #457172)
  * Don't give select more nfds than necessary. (Closes: #457173)
  * Reformat all the patch headers.
  * Include note about the use of http_proxy in examples/webproxy. (Closes:
    #308687)
  * Edit EXAMPLES pointer in man page, and add an examples section to
    README.Debian. (Closes: #450676)

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sun, 20 Jan 2008 21:43:44 -0500

netcat (1.10-33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cleaned up sh-c.patch, removing duplicated code and fixing -c behavior for
    outgoing connections (Closes: #365632)
  * Don't redirect stderr to the network (Closes: #365626)

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Thu, 29 Mar 2007 13:32:37 -0400

netcat (1.10-32) unstable; urgency=low

    - Also added proper decriptions to all patches and fixed all the
      credits for who contributed each one.
    - Fixes application of rservice-buf.patch.
    - Combined nosleep.patch and nosleep.diff.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Wed,  8 Mar 2006 17:38:18 -0500

netcat (1.10-30) unstable; urgency=low

  * In man page, clarify that EOF is something you get on stdin, not on a
    socket. (Closes: #349906)
  * Use strncpy and check bounds in examples/data/rservice.c to prevent a
    possible buffer overflow. (Closes: #352369)

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Thu, 23 Feb 2006 10:07:05 -0500

netcat (1.10-29) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sun, 11 Dec 2005 17:51:22 -0500

netcat (1.10-28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add patch: 25_tos.dpatch. I'm not exactly sure how this happened, but I
    never got mail for this report and was just combing through bugs tagged
    "patch" now. Hooray for year-and-a-half late fixes. Also added some
    documentation to it. (Closes: #275753)
  * Standards-Version: 3.6.2.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sun, 11 Dec 2005 15:08:02 -0500

netcat (1.10-27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add documentation for Mike Sullivan's dashes-in-port-names patch.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Tue, 23 Nov 2004 19:04:43 -0500

netcat (1.10-26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add -c option, from patch by Jan Minar. (Closes: #265583)
  * Actually include ncmeter this time. (Whoops!)

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sun,  3 Oct 2004 17:49:33 -0400

netcat (1.10-25) unstable; urgency=low

  * Included new example script, ncmeter, by Karsten KÃ¶m <koem@petoria.de>.
  * Added patch by Mike Sullivan <msully4321@gmail.com> to allow the use of
    port names containing "-", as long as the dash is escaped with a
    backslash. (e.g. "netcat localhost 'ftp\-data'"). (Closes: #10486)
  * Updated 12_single_verbose to be quiet if -z is on. (Closes: #247895)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.1.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sat,  2 Oct 2004 09:54:56 -0400

netcat (1.10-24) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix inverted noopt logic (was building with -O0 by default).

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Wed, 27 Aug 2003 10:00:47 -0400

netcat (1.10-23) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Waiting for Paolo" release.
  * Use dpatch. I really should have done this a while ago.
  * Use debhelper v4 and comply with policy 3.6.0.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Sun, 24 Aug 2003 11:34:27 -0400

netcat (1.10-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Broke apart all the various patches that have accumulated over the years,
    and put them in a crappy, ad-hoc DBS-like system. This is nowhere near
    perfect, but I'd rather wait for the new dpkg-source than muck around with
    my 4.5-year-old .orig.tar.gz just so I can repack things in such a way
    that DBS is usable. In the long run, separating the patches should make
    maintenance much easier, although technically getting that to work
    (without simply using DBS) may take a few tries. I'm not going to attempt
    to get this into Woody or anything.
  * Applied patch to prevent possible buffer overflow (Closes: #145801)
  * Updated URL and email in debian/netcat.copyright (Hobbit has been at
    @Stake for a while; I sent him a ping email with the split-up patches.)
  * The nc binary is now installed into /bin (thanks to Robot101, doogie, and
    dsp for bringing this up on IRC.) As far as I can tell, there aren't
    really any general-purpose networking tools available on a Debian system
    without /usr mounted, and this should hopefully fix that. If anyone
    disagrees I'd be happy to listen to whatever objections they have. Perhaps
    netcat's priority should be raised to standard in light of this, but I'll
    wait and see.

netcat (1.10-21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documented -e in man page. (Closes: #131269)

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Tue, 29 Jan 2002 16:30:30 -0500

netcat (1.10-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved around shutdown call in -q patch to be more compatible with standard
    nc. Thanks to Dmitry Chernyak <cdl@inkasbank.ru> for pointing this out.
  * Applied UDP broadcast patch from NetBSD (Closes: #108182)
    - Updated man page to document this option
    - Also applied patch to use inet_aton instead of IADDR_NONE (which is
      obsolete), so that it will work.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.5.6.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Tue,  9 Oct 2001 18:08:24 -0400

netcat (1.10-19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reupload source package (my typo fix was lost due to a misconfigured
    dput). This should really fix #97583.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Fri,  1 Jun 2001 18:18:17 -0400

netcat (1.10-18) unstable; urgency=low

    disabled (Closes: #98902)
  * Install a symlink to the nc binary called 'netcat'. (Closes: #97625)

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Fri,  1 Jun 2001 13:13:25 -0400

netcat (1.10-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added include for <resolv.h>, which is needed to compile with recent
    versions of glibc.
  * Added patch to always print "connection refused" messages, without having
    to turn on the other junk that -v prints. (Closes: #65413)
  * Upgraded to debhelper 3 and policy 3.5.2.0.
  * Added DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS =~ /debug/ support.

 -- Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>  Wed, 28 Feb 2001 16:53:33 -0500

netcat (1.10-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. (Closes: #80305)
  * Updated debhelper rules to v2. Also cleaned up/moved some targets and dh_*
    options.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.2.1.0.
  * Compress README file, as per policy.
  * Applied -q patch properly (Closes: #62402). I think that this is also what
    caused #71616, but I'll hold off on closing that one.
  * Added README.Debian explanation about -e. This is possibly the problem
    behind #66355, so maybe I can close that as well.
